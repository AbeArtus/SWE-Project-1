### Preferred format to display a recipe online:
(you'll need to look at the plaintext, markdown will render this weird)

----
name of recipe on the first line
description here
#
ingredients here
#
(maybe we can denote the type of cooking instructions like this:)
##On The Stove:
(for proper html list formatting, it would be easier to leave the numbers
off, maybe list each instruction like:)
-step
-another step
-another step

##In the Microwave:
-step
-another step
-another step

##To assemble:
-assemble
