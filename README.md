# SWE-Project-1
Final project for the SWE class: "The fridge app"



## Requirements

**Fill with X when completed**

[  ]  Some portion of the software product must involve persistent data stored on a disk or database which
lasts longer than a user’s individual ”session” using the application.

[  ]  Some portion of the software product’s functionality must be packaged and accessed as a web service
hosted from an Internet-accessible hosting service (of which many free services exist and can be used).

[  ]  Some portion of the software product’s functionality must be only accessible after user has authenti-
cated themselves to the software product via either a custom authentication system (i.e., the software
stores usernames and passwords such that the user must enter a correct pair of username and password
data) or a third-party integrated authentication system (e.g., Google account). It may be that some
functionality is accessible without authentication or the software knowing the identity of the user.

[  ] The software product development lifecycle must have some form of continuous integration and exe-
cutable testing such that on commit or push to GitHub some automated actions are taken to compile /
build and execute tests to ensure new changes have not broken functionality (which is tested, anyway).
