1. Spray a microwavable cup with cooking spray.
Crack egg into cup. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper.
With a fork, beat egg until thoroughly mixed. Microwave on high power for 1 minute. The egg should look dry without runny bits. If it doesn't, microwave for 10 seconds at a time until done.

2. While the egg is cooking, toast bread on the light to medium setting.

3. Layer egg, cheese, and ham on a slice of toast. Spread ketchup, if desired, on the other slice and close sandwich. Eat immediately.
