It may not be exactly like Mom's, but this hearty, warm meal will put a smile on your face. Make it your own by experimenting with the spices while pan frying the chicken--try lemon juice and garlic salt, taco seasoning, or lime juice and honey.

2. Fill a large saucepan with 4 to 5 quarts of water and add potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork.

3. Drain liquid. Add butter, salt, pepper, and milk and use a hand mixer to whip. Cover and set aside.

4. Microwave beans according to package instructions. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately with chicken and mashed potatoes.
