2. In the same frying pan, add 1 teaspoon of the oil, peppers, onions, and garlic and cook for about 5 to 6 minutes, until softened. Remove from heat and set aside.

3. In a large saucepan bring 4 to 5 quarts of water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions. Meanwhile, slice sausage into bite-sized rounds.Drain pasta, reserving ½ cup of the pasta water.

4. Return pasta to the saucepan and add the remaining oil, cheese, sausage, and vegetables. Mix thoroughly with a large spoon. If the mixture seems dry add a bit of the reserved pasta water. Serve immediately.
