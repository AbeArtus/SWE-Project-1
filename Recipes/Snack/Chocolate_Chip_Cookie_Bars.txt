1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and position a rack in the center of the oven. Spray a 9-inch square baking pan with baking spray 

2. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a medium bowl combine butter and sugars with a large spoon or hand mixer until thoroughly combined. Add egg and vanilla. Mix, occasionally scraping down the sides of the bowl, for about 2 minutes.

4. Add half the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix until combined. Repeat with the remaining flour mixture. Stir in chocolate chips.

5. Pour dough into the prepared pan and place in the center of the oven. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until the top is dry and golden brown and the sides pull away from the pan.

6. Place the pan on the stove top to cool for 10 minutes. Invert it onto a plate and cut into bars.
