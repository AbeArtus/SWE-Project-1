7 minutes

This rich, savory salad is a far cry from the tasteless offerings at a dining hall salad bar. Add cooked chicken to make it even heartier.
#
¼ head lettuce
½ cup feta cheese
¼ cup kalamata olives
½ cup cucumber slices
½ cup grape tomatoes halved lengthwise
¼ cup sliced red onions
Balsamic Vinaigrette (page 67) to taste
#
1. Wash and dry lettuce (see page 66). With clean hands or a knife, tear or cut lettuce into bite-sized pieces. Place in a salad bowl.

2. Top with feta, olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, and onions.

3. Toss with vinaigrette and serve.
