Often you won't have enough time between classes to go back to your room or to the dining hall for a bite to eat. This problem is easily solved by packing it to go.
#
2 hard-boiled eggs, sliced
1 tablespoon minced onion 
1 tablespoon relish
Pinch of salt
Pinch of ground black pepper
1 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 leaf romaine lettuce
2 slices whole wheat bread
2 slices cheese
#
1. In a small bowl, mash eggs. Add onion, relish, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise. Mix until well combined.

2. Place lettuce on one slice of bread, stack a slice of cheese on top, and spread egg mixture on cheese.
Top with remaining cheese and bread.

3. Optional step for eating on the go: Wrap sandwich tightly in plastic wrap. As you eat, unwrap a small section at time. This helps keep all of the filling between the bread, where it belongs, rather than on your keyboard.
