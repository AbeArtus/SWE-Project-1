1. Coat a medium-sized skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat for 1 minute.

2. Lower heat to medium-low, and add meat. Cook, using a spatula to break apart, for about 6 minutes, or until meat is no longer pink.

3. Remove from heat. Add seasoning and ½ cup wa-ter. Stir until combined and thickened.

4. On each tortilla, spread half of the filling, cheese, salsa, sour cream, and lettuce. Close wraps. Serve immediately.
