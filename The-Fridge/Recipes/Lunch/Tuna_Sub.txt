1. Place tuna in a small bowl. With a fork, flake it into small pieces. Add onion, celery, salt, pepper, and mayonnaise. Mix until combined.

2. With a serrated or bread knife, slice the roll lengthwise about three-quarters of the way through, leaving the opposite side uncut. Open the roll like a book and place lettuce, cheese, and tuna mixture inside. Close roll and wrap in plastic wrap until ready to eat.
